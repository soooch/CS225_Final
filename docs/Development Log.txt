Development Log

	The final project group collectively chose to meet on discord to discuss
	the project goals and write a team contract. Every member agreed to the
	team contract and uploaded their respective version to the github
	repository. For our project goals we decided to use the openflight data
	set. We also planned to implment the pagerank algorithm and Dijkstra's
	algorithm. We will be using a BFS to traverse our respective graph. The
	only development done this week was organizing the readme to show what 
	functions the group still needs to implement.

	We collectively as group decided that there will be no mandatory work to
	be done over the break. However, people were still free to work on the 
	project if they wanted to. During the break our group managed to develop
	a program that is able to parse the OpenFlight dataset. We are now able
	to read in the OpenFlights dataset and add airports to our graph.
