Final project

## Potential functions to implement

### General Use
 - Read OpenFlight data into internal representation. Probably directly to graph.

### Dijkstra's Algorithm
 - Create graph with distance/time edges.
 - Actually run Dijkstra's

### PageRank Algorithm
 - Create graph with "bandwidth" edges (number of routes in between).
 - Actually run PageRank
