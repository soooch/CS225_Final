## Potential functions to implement

### General Use
 - Convert OpenFlight data into internal representation. Probably directly to graph.
  - Matrix? Vectors of pointers?

### Dijkstra's Algorithm
 - Create graph with distance/time edges.
  - Calculate distance/time based on provided location data
 - Actually run Dijkstra's
  - Potentially choose to prioritize time or distance

### PageRank Algorithm
 - Create graph with "bandwidth" edges (number of routes in between).
 - Actually run PageRank
  - Learn how to actually run Pagerank
